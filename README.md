# Automated-playlist-creator
Automated playlist creator for Spotify


This project is meant for the creation of automated playlist using the songs from your "liked songs" playlist.
The algorithm will use ML to classify the song, and depending on the genre of the song it will either create a playlist (if it doesn't already exists) named after the genre of the song, or add the song to the already existing playlist.
